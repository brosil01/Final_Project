### Brosil Bajracharya:
Redesigned the header section and nav bar. Added hover effect and active class stage to let the user
know which webpage they are using. Rebuilt the design in passwords page, adding multiple transparent
layers. Also maintained the consistent space with in the elements.  Vertically realigned field 
elements in the table. Relocated the button and, added design and transition. Also, added the slight
touch of border. All these things made the page really attractive. Added a menu button on the right
side which will allow to either edit or delete the data and will also reflect on the front and 
back end on the real time. When user clicks on the edit, the field insertion display will pop up
with preloaded respective datas. Then made the website more mobile friendly. The layout of the
table datas will change on the mobile view to display the data in a better way. Also, same with
the header bar, if there is not enough space then the menu icon will replace the nav elements 
and they are all available with in the menu icon on the right which will pop up on click. Added
necessary HTML elements, CSS and JS functions to deliver excellent user experience.


### Jonathan Pacheco:
My contribution was a visual and rather artistic one. I was in charge of the web design of the
password manager. This meant working with HTML and CSS to provide our website with a fresh, unique
look that gives the sense and emotion of going out for a fresh morning walk. A whole host of CSS 
elements were used, from backgrounds to padding to shadows, which all contribute to the website's 
fashionable design. I made sure that all links worked correctly and that when pressed, the buttons 
take the user to where they intend to. This is to say that this was no easy task, and many hours 
were poured into this effort to achieve a coherent artistic vision which is sure to delight users 
upon use. In the end, after much trial and error, hardware and software issues, a wonderful program 
was produced for all to enjoy.







### Phillip Davis:
Mostly worked on the backend. Setup the Atlas account, Create the password route, model, and 
controller for get and post. Created the skeleton for list.ejs to test the backend to the database.
Also worked on encrypting the passwords in the database, but was not able to get the implementation
to work. Setup the client side form validation






### Tyler Duong: 
Setting up the render.com account and server to deploy the web app. Mostly worked on the list.ejs 
file, which is the password page for the website. Within this added the functionality to the “add new”
button, which created a darkened overlay and pop-up to show, allowing you to fill out the form to
submit a “website, email, and password”. I created the cancel button within the popup to change both 
the overlay and the popup to display: none. Needed help on creating an updated format, and was able to
get help from Brosil. Did the CSS and JS necessary for this as well. Tried my best to keep the team
on top of things and communicated as efficiently as possible.
