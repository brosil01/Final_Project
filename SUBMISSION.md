# Final Project â€“ Reflection

Working on the PassNest group project was a valuable learning experience that helped me better understand collaborative development and real-world application structure. Through this project, I strengthened my JavaScript and DOM manipulation skills, while also learning how to work with templates like EJS and routes in a Node.js environment.

My main contribution was improving the UI, polishing the layout, and integrating the app smoothly into my personal portfolio. I also gained experience using Git and GitHub in a group setting, which helped me coordinate changes and track progress effectively.

Overall, this project helped me grow as a developer and better prepare for future teamwork in software development environments.
